# 1)Write a python program to add two numbers.

# a = 25
# b = 30

# print(b + a)

# 2) Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.
# a = 25
# b = 5

# c = a % b 
# print("The remainder is: ", c)  


# Check the type of variable assigned using input () function.

# name = input("Enter your name: ")

# b = type(name)
# print("The type of the variable is: ", b)


# Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than 
# ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80 
# a = 36
# b = 80

# c = a > b
# print("Is a greater than b? ", c)




# Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.
# a = int(input("Enter a value for a: "))
# b = int(input("Enter a value for b: "))

# c = (a + b)/2
# print("The average of a and b is: ", c)



# Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.
# a = int(input("Enter a value for a: "))

# b = a ** 2
# print("The square of a is: ", b)
